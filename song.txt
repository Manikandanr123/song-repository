There's a place in your heart
And I know that it is love
And this place could much brighter than tomorrow
And if you really try
You'll find there's no need to cry
In this place, you'll feel there's no hurt or sorrow

There are ways to get there
If you care enough for the living
Make a little space
Make a better place
--making first commit
